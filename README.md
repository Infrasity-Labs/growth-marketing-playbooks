# Growth Marketing Playbooks

**A curated set of growth marketing playbooks covering DevRel, developer marketing, and community growth strategies — created from hands-on experience working with some of the fastest-growing AI and code review companies, including Kubiya.ai, Qodo ,Aviator, Scalekit and many more early stage B2B AI startups.**

## 📖 Overview

This repository is an **open-source library** of actionable marketing playbooks designed for:
- **DevRel teams** who need to scale developer engagement without burning out engineering resources.
- **Startup founders** looking for repeatable GTM strategies that have worked in real-world B2B SaaS and AI markets.
- **Community managers** building active and loyal user bases.

Each playbook here comes from campaigns and GTM motions we’ve actually run — not theory.  
They’ve been tested with venture-backed startups in AI infrastructure, code review automation, and developer tooling.
